For this project, we were tasked to prepare a storyborard for a human-centred data story related to a topical concern which includes the design sketches, prototypes and notes to show various iterations.

I decided to share about video games sales Analysis.My main objectives were to identifyemerging trends, assess consumer preferences, and pinpoint opportunities and successes
within the gaming industry, particularly focusing on the addictive nature of games, especially among male players. 

The dataset, which I sourced from Kaggle, includes various details such asgame titles, rankings, platforms, release years, genres, publishers, sales figures across four regions, and global sales totals.

The first iteration of this assignment is from Miro a collaboration tool, to establish the contextand framework for my video game sales analysis. 

The second iteration of my project, I developed a storyboard using my sketchbook to illustrate how video game sales have declined due to the rise of digitalization. 

The third iteration, I created a more refined storyboard using Google Slides, closely following the format of the previous version but incorporating visuals and graphs to emphasize
the themeâ€”video game sales analysis.
