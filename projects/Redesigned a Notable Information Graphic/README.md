John Snow’s groundbreaking work in 1854 is often celebrated as one of the earliest applications of data visualization to address a public health crisis. 

Faced with a cholera outbreak in London, Snow mapped the locations of cholera cases, eventually tracing the source to a contaminated water pump on Broad Street. 

His work not only saved lives but also demonstrated the power of visual data analysis in uncovering the root causes of public health issues. 

For this project, we were asked to redesign a significant historical information graphic using contemporary, interactive methods.

I chose to reimagine Snow’s cholera map, drawing on both the historical significance of the outbreak and my familiarity with the subject matter. 

My primary goal was to create an interactive visualization of the cholera outbreak, highlighting the correlation between water pump locations and death counts. 

The redesign is intended to enhance user engagement and deepen data comprehension.

Through interactive features like tooltips and filters, users can explore the outbreak data in a dynamic way, focusing on specific regions or time periods as they choose. 

This approach not only honors John Snow's original mission to use data visualization for public health awareness but also updates it to meet the expectations of modern audiences who value intuitive, interactive insights.
